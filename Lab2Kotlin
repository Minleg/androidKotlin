// product = null
// kotlin doesn't allow null value unless you specify that the value could be null with ? operator
// which is not the case with product

/** Conditional Code **/

//  variable is 1 or more.

//  For example, if your function is called with "Albatross" and "Bird" it will return "Albatross" because it has more letters.
//  For example, if your function is called with "Cat" and "Elephant" it will return "Elephant" because it has more letters.
//  For example, if your function is called with "Cat" and "Dog" it will return "Cat" because the two strings have the same number of letters, but "Cat" is the first argument.
